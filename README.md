# JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I learn and practice JavaScript. I will be regularly updating this repository with code examples, projects, and notes related to JavaScript.



## Getting Started

If you're new to JavaScript or want to follow along with my learning journey, feel free to explore the code and notes in this repository. Here are a few things you'll find:

- **Code Snippets**: I'll be adding small code snippets to demonstrate various JavaScript concepts.
- **Mini Projects**: I'll create and document small JavaScript projects to apply what I've learned.
- **Notes**: I'll keep notes on JavaScript fundamentals, best practices, and any challenges I encounter.

## Code Examples

Here are some JavaScript code snippets that I've found useful or interesting during my learning process:

- [Example 1: How to declare a variable](code_examples/example1.js)
- [Example 2: Using loops to iterate through an array](code_examples/example2.js)
- [Example 3: Event handling with JavaScript](code_examples/example3.js)

Feel free to explore these examples and use them in your own learning projects.
